# Real life addition âž•ðŸ¤–ðŸŸ°
### Overview:  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/real-life-addition/ 

Kaggle ML competition on digit recognition, but different to classic MNIST, ground truth is the sum of the numbers in the image. \
Multiclass classification problem, I used Python (Jupyter notebook) and took a CNN approach.  

Prerequisite for course on Predictive and Classification Modelling at McGill University.

### Data Sample:

6 + 3 + 5 = 14

5 + 0 + 4 = 9 

### Structure:
Multilayer CNN

### Overall results:
86.5% test accuracy (Kaggle performed testing evaluation on 30% original test data, 70% other private data)  
92.9% train accuracy  
Model significantly overfit, as training accuracy was 6% higher than test accuracy. 

### Possible improvements:
- Add L1/L2 Regularization
- Reduce model complexity (remove some convolution layers)
- Try dropout with a higher rate, or more dropout layers.
